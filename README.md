# 🎲 Smart Ludo — AI-Powered Ludo Game

Smart Ludo is a Python-based, 2D Ludo game that uses reinforcement learning (via Stable-Baselines3 and PPO) to simulate intelligent AI opponents. Designed with Gym and visualized using Pygame, this project showcases how machine learning can power a classic board game.

## 🚀 Features

- AI opponents trained using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
- Human vs AI gameplay
- 2D board visualization using Pygame
- Custom Gym environment (`LudoEnv`)
- Token logic with safe zones, rewards, and captures

## 🧠 Tech Stack
